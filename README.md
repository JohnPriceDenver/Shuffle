# Shuffle
Shuffle Deck App in C#
Welcome to ShuffleDrawConsole.

You will find the executible for this app under folders...ShuffleDrawConsole\ShuffleDrawConsole.

Look for ShuffleDrawConsole.exe

Simply double click on the exe and this console app will run showing you a listing of shuffled cards.

This app is written in C#, you can find the sln file under the folder ShuffleDrawConsole with the attendent code classes
under ShuffleDrawConsole\ShuffleDrawConsole.

If you are wondering why I wrote a simple console app, well my first idea was to write this with MVC.  I started 
down that path but for some reason ran into stupid difficulties getting the View and the Controller to communicate.

After staring at it for half a day and trying various things I eventually gave up.  There's probably a silly typo I'm 
overlooking but I just couldn't see it.  Another pair of eyes might find it quickly but I didn't have another 
dev to look at it with me.  

And that's possibly a good thing, MVC is definitely overkill for this one. 

With that in mind, I decided clean and simple to be the best approach and that's what I've done here.

If you have any questions, let me know.
